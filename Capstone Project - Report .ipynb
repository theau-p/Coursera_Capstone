In other words, there are very few or no gyms in the historical heart of the city and the farther you get from the center of town, the more there are gyms. This organization in \"circular layers\" can be explained by different factors but mainly because of the lack of space in the heart of the city, which pushes investors to establish gyms in places with more space and where property prices are lower. In places where the urban density is lower, fitness centers, which require a big surface, can be found in greater number."
